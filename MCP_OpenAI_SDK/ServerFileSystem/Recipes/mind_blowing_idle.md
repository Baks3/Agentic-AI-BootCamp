# Authentic Idli Dosa Recipe

Idli and Dosa are traditional South Indian dishes that are popular across India and beyond. Here's an authentic recipe for making soft Idlis and crispy Dosas.

## Ingredients

### For Idli
- **Rice:** 2 cups (preferably idli rice or parboiled rice)
- **Urad Dal:** 1 cup (split black gram)
- **Fenugreek Seeds:** 1/2 tsp
- **Salt:** to taste
- **Water:** as needed

### For Dosa
- **Idli Batter:** from the above preparation
- **Oil or Ghee:** for cooking

## Instructions

### 1. Soaking the Ingredients
- **Rice and Dal:** Wash the rice and urad dal separately. Soak the rice and fenugreek seeds together in enough water for **6-8 hours** (or overnight).
- Soak urad dal separately in water for the same duration.

### 2. Grinding the Batter
- **Urad Dal:** Drain the urad dal and blend it with a little water to a smooth, fluffy paste.
- **Rice:** Drain the rice and blend it until you get a slightly coarse batter. Mix both batters in a large bowl.
- **Fermentation:** Cover and let it ferment in a warm place for **8-12 hours** until it doubles in size. Add salt after fermentation.

### 3. Making Idlis
- **Idli Steamer:** Grease idli plates with a little oil. Pour the batter into each mold, filling it halfway.
- **Steaming:** Steam in an idli steamer for **10-12 minutes** or until a toothpick comes out clean.
- **Cooling:** Remove and let them cool slightly before taking the idlis out.

### 4. Making Dosas
- **Dosa Batter:** Heat a non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Pour a ladleful of batter and spread it in a circular motion to form thin dosas.
- **Cooking:** Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges. Cook until the edges turn golden and crispy, about **2-3 minutes**. Flip and cook for another minute if desired.
- **Serving:** Serve hot with coconut chutney and sambar.

## Tips
- **Fermentation:** The fermentation time may vary depending on the climate; a warm environment helps in quicker fermentation.
- **Serving:** Idlis are best served with sambar and coconut chutney, while dosas can be enjoyed with a variety of chutneys.

## Conclusion
Enjoy the delightful combination of soft idlis and crispy dosas with your favorite accompaniments!
