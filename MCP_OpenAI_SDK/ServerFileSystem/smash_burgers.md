# Smash Burgers Recipe

## Ingredients
- **For the burgers:**
  - 2 lbs ground beef (preferably 80/20)
  - Salt
  - Freshly ground black pepper
- **For the toppings:**
  - American cheese slices
  - Brioche or potato burger buns
  - Lettuce
  - Tomato (sliced)
  - Pickles
  - Ketchup
  - Mustard
  - Onion (optional, diced or grilled)

## Equipment
- Cast iron skillet or griddle
- Spatula
- Parchment paper (optional)
- Meat thermometer (optional)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Beef
1. **Form the patties:** Divide the ground beef into 2-ounce balls. Do not overwork the meat; the less you handle it, the better.

### Step 2: Preheat the Skillet
2. **Heat the skillet:** Place the cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat and allow it to get very hot. You can add a small amount of oil to the skillet if desired.

### Step 3: Smash the Burgers
3. **Cook the meat:** Once the skillet is hot, place the beef balls on the skillet, spacing them out evenly. Using the spatula, press down firmly on each ball to flatten it out into a patty, about 1/4 inch thick. The edges should be slightly crisp.
4. **Season:** Immediately season the patties generously with salt and pepper.

### Step 4: Flip and Add Cheese
5. **Wait for juices:** Allow the burgers to cook for about 2-3 minutes or until you see juices pooling on the surface.
6. **Flip the patties:** Using the spatula, carefully flip the patties over. If you want cheese, place a slice on each patty at this stage and allow it to melt for about 1-2 minutes.

### Step 5: Toast the Buns
7. **Toast the buns:** While the burgers are cooking, slice your buns in half and toast them on the skillet until golden brown.

### Step 6: Assemble the Burgers
8. **Build the burgers:** Start with the bottom bun, add the patty with melted cheese, followed by lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, and your choice of condiments. Top with the top bun.

### Step 7: Serve
9. **Enjoy:** Serve immediately with fries or your favorite side dishes!

## Tips
- **Use a good quality beef** for the best flavor. 80/20 ground beef is ideal for juicy burgers.
- **Don't press down** on the patty after smashing; this helps keep the juices inside.
- **Experiment with different toppings** to find your perfect combination!
